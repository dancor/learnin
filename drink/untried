(10:28:59) llamagui: The Big Breezy is one of the original cocktails that was
created by Simon Ford specifically for Absolut New Orleans vodka. It's a     
great martini that compliments the flavors of the mango- and black pepper-   
infused vodka and tastes almost like a watermelon Jolly Rancher with a little
spice.
