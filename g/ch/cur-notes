after black Qc7:

imbalances
- minor
  my e3 bishop is a bit blocked by my d4 pawn.
  my c4 bishop is good and active.
  his bishops seem good but his c8 bishop is undeveloped currently..
  his knight is more advanced than mine, but both are involved with d5.
- pawn
  my isolated a pawn, shouldn't matter so much until endgame..?
  his pawns look ok but he has one less center pawn..
- space
  i have more central space and am threatening to advance my central pawns
  even more.  he may have more potential space on the queenside?
- material
  even.  i could win a pawn this turn but then i would have three isolated
  pawns, two of them doubled and new.  and i would have one less center pawn..
- file/square
  he's more likely to get the d-file soon?  but i could have action on the
  b-file..
- development
  close?  but he's moved his queen instead of queen bishop so far
- initiative
  i feel like i am free to choose the next immediate plan for the game, tho
  he has made both dxc5 and d5 have less effect than the would have..

i don't think i can do much on the king side.. i could play f4.. or Bf4..

after black Qxd7:

min: my knight is better, same advanced but his can't move right now and is on
  side
pawn: even?  we both have trickiness with the c file..
space: i have more center.. queenside is weird..
material: even.
f/s: even?  there aren't targets.. my b-file is prob better than his d or e..
dev: even?  my rooks ready to double..
init: i have to deal with c3 pawn

i could prob do center or queen

center: bishop to d4 somehow or h6
